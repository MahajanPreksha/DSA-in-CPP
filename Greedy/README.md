# Introduction
- In general, there are 4 types of algorithmic paradigms:
1. Divide and Conquer
2. Brute Force
3. Dynamic Programming
4. Greedy
- Greedy Algorithms allow us to build solution piece by piece. We don't explore all possibilities/global optimum.
- Greedy choice focusses on local optimum.
- **Optimal Substructure**: There is a bigger problem which needs to be divided into smaller problems. If you get the optimal answer for smaller problems and using those answers, you create an optimal answer for bigger problem, then the problem has the property of Optimal Substructure.

> Note: You need to ensure if the solution is **feasible** (constraints should be satisfied) and **optimal** (should get extremum answer).

## Applications of Greedy Algorithms
1. Game Theory problems
2. Permutation and Combination (Combinatorics) problems
3. Graph Theory problems
4. Computer Network problems
5. Machine Learning problems

## Advantages of Greedy Algorithms
1. Easy to implement
2. Good time complexity (sometimes, even better than DP)

## Disadvantage of Greedy Algorithms
1. No guarantee of finding optimal solution
