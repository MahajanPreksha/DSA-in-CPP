# Introduction
- Basic Recursion is basically a brute-force technique i.e. a problem is divided into smaller sub-problems.
- It involves: Base Case, Assumption and Self-Work.
- Backtracking is used to increase efficiency and add optimisation.
- In backtracking, we introduce the concept of pruning that helps to eliminate the failed cases, thus optimising the code.
