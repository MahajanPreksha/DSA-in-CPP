# Multidimensional Arrays
A Multidimensional Array is an array of arrays.

Syntax of declaring a Multidimensional Array:
```cpp
    data_type array_name [size1][size2][size3]...[size_n];
```

# 2D Arrays
A 2D array is a mutidimensional array with 2 dimensions.

Syntax of declaring a 2D Array:
```cpp
    data_type array_name[row][col];
```

Example: 
```cpp
    int arr[4][3]; //A 2D array with 4 rows and 3 columns
```

## Representation of 2D Arrays
A 2D array can be represented into the form of table or matrix (rows and columns).

To access an element of 2D array, we use ```a[i][j]``` where i is the row number and j is the column number.

> 2D Arrays also have 0-based indexing.

> **Note**: Number of elements in a 2D array = n * m where n = number of rows and m = number of columns in the array.

### Uses of Multidimensional Arrays
Multidimensional Array are used:
1. To represent grids.
2. For faster and simpler access.
3. There is a predefined size.

# 2D Vectors
A 2D vector is a vector of vector datatype.

Syntax of declaring a 2D vector:
```cpp
    vector<vector<data_type>> vector_name;
```
